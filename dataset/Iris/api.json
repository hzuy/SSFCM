The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.\n\nPredicted attribute: class of iris plant.\n\nThis is an exceedingly simple domain.\n\nThis data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,\"Iris-setosa\" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,\"Iris-setosa\" where the errors are in the second and third features.
