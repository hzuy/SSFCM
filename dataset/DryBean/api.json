A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.","purpose":null,"funded_by":null,"instances_represent":null,"recommended_data_splits":null,"sensitive_data":null,"preprocessing_description":null,"variable_info":"1.)
